#
# This is load-bearing, not cosmetic. Every module here is released at
# one version from one commit and requires its siblings at exactly that
# version — a version that does not exist on the proxy until the tag is
# pushed. `go mod tidy` ignores go.work, so the replace is the only thing
# that lets the release commit resolve, tidy and build. Lose one and the
# next release fails at `make tidy`, or silently pins that module to the
# previous release.
#
# Consumers ignore a replace in a dependency and get the require, which
# names the commit the module was tagged from. release-guard is what
# proves that correspondence.
