# Cut a release: the changelog's Unreleased section is dated, everything
# is checked, one commit is made, the tag is guarded and then written
# with the changelog section as its message, and the branch and tag are
# pushed. TRAILER, when set, is appended to the commit message.
#
# The guard runs after the commit and before the tag, which is the last
# moment everything is still local: if it refuses, undo with git reset
# --hard HEAD~1. Nothing is public until the push.
#
# --atomic lands the branch and the tag in one transaction, so no window
# exists in which the tag is visible without the commit it names.
#
# The changelog is dated through a temp file rather than sed -i, which is
# a GNU-ism: BSD sed reads the argument after -i as a backup suffix, so
# the GNU spelling fails outright on macOS, where these releases are cut.
# The temp file is removed if sed dies, so a failed run leaves nothing
# untracked behind for the clean-tree gate to trip over next time.
